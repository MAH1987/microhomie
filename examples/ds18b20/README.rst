Microhomie ds18b20 temperature sensor
=====================================

This is an example node for the One-Wire ds18b20 temperature sensor, shared by `palmtreefrb <https://github.com/microhomie/microhomie/issues/31>`_

This example will only return the first sensor on the bus as One-Wire can have many sensors on one gpio. It can be quite easily be modified to enumerate all sensors.
