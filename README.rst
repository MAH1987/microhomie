Microhomie is a MicroPython framework for `Homie <https://github.com/homieiot/convention>`_, a lightweight MQTT convention for the IoT. Main target for Microhomie is the ESP8266 device and has been well tested and used on ESP32.

Microhomie v2 implements `Homie v4.0.0 <https://github.com/homieiot/convention/releases/tag/v4.0.0>`_.

Read the `Microhomie documentation <https://microhomie.readthedocs.io>`_ to get started.

If you want to make your own node, learn from our examples until we have a "howto build nodes" section in the documentation or join the #microhomie channel on the `MicroPython Slack community <https://slack-micropython.herokuapp.com/>`_ and chat with us.

Binaries can be verified with `minisign <https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/>`_ and the following public key:

MicroPython changes
-------------------

* **btree** support disabled to save some space
* AccessPoint SSID changed to `Microhomie-MAC` with the secret `microhomiE`
* inisetup.py writes a custom boot.py


Install
-------

Download the `latest image <https://github.com/microhomie/microhomie/releases>`_ and flash it like any MicroPython image to your ESP8266 device. I.E:

.. code-block:: shell

    esptool --port PORT --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect --verify -fm dio 0x0 microhomie-esp8266-VERSION.bin

Make your changes in `settings.example.py` and copy this file as `settings.py` to your device. You can now test our example nodes from `examples/`, just copy the `main.py` to your device. Start with the `examples/led` node to turn on and off the on-board LED.


Build image
-----------

To build your own Microhomie image run:

.. code-block:: shell

    make bootstrap
    make
    make delpoy PORT=/dev/ttyUSBX


Known issues
------------

* No SSL support for now
